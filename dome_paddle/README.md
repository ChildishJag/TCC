# Dome Paddle 

## Summary
Replaces the wired dome paddle with an arduino driven wireless paddle. 
Includes both send and recieve code for arduinos connected with bluetooth, 
but most mature approach is using a game controller and a single arduino to recieve and connect directly
to the telescopes traditional dome paddle circuitry. We're using an wireless X-Box controller and receiver.

## Installing
Jag--what's the game controller library?

Unknown how we'll connect to the telescope hardware at this point.
